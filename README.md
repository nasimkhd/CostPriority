# CostPriority
Introduction 

In this code, you will code and execute a C language program that implements a simple validation
on a series of user input values that are stored to arrays and later analyzed to produce a variety of
summary reports. The program will ask for the userâ€™s monthly income and then ask for the price and
priority of a series of items the user would like to purchase in the future. It will store this information
and allow the user to view predictions on how long it will take to save enough money to purchase their
wish list items.
